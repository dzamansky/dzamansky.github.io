# Why knit?

Look around during any conference or meeting. How many people are playing with a pen, twirling their hair around a finger, tapping their foot -- **checking their phones**?  And how many have zoned out and are daydreaming or thinking of other things? 

Chances are good that the fidgeters are paying attention and retaining information at a rate somewhat greater than the non-fidgeter. There is scientific evidence to back this up. The phone checkers? The daydreamers? Not so much. 

But wait! What’s that? Your sessions are so engaging that no one is fidgeting?

Really? No one? 

Let’s be realistic. While conference sessions should all be conveying vital information, they are not equally engaging for everyone. What one person finds totally engrossing another finds simply interesting and yet someone else is there because their boss made them go.

How can you keep these last two types of participants from squirming and going off task? 

Give them something productive to do that also helps to focus them on the session content.

This is where we come in.

## Knitting is a form of productive fidgeting. 

Simple projects can keep the hands busy while not engaging the part of the brain needed to process the information being conveyed by the presenter. 

And ...  it produces something tangible that itself can be used as a fidget tool or, when joined with others, a blanket.


Let us help your conference participants get more out of the sessions by providing them with the tools needed to focus.

## What Participants Do:

Blanket Statement participants will produce simple knitted or crocheted blocks either during sessions or during breaks. Blocks will be turned into the Blanket Statement outpost. The 7 X 9 inch blocks will then be assembled by a Blanket Statement staffer into a blanket than can then be donated, auctioned or given away as the conference organizers see fit.

## What we provide:

- Knitting instruction and assistance before and after conference sessions and during designated breaks and mealtimes as well as in the evenings at the main conference hotel.
* Instruction includes
* Casting on
* Knitting
* Purling (if desired)
* Binding off
* Fixing mistakes
* Basic knitting knowledge including:
- figuring out	which way the knitting was going
- Why the piece keeps getting larger / smaller
- “Reading” the knitting to figure out knit/purl sequence

- A space for participants to take a “timeout” in order to regroup and process the information obtained during conference sessions. 
- All materials necessary to produce at least one 49 block blanket with:
- Conference logo incorporated into one or more blocks (if logo is simple)
- Yarn colors based on a theme chosen by the organizers
- Assembly of the blanket either during or immediately following the conference

* Basic Materials provided:
* Knitting needles and crochet hooks
* Yarn wound into portions large enough to complete one block
* Enough yarn will be provided to complete at least one blanket. Amounts will be determined by number of overall conference participants. 
* Ball bands printed with a ruler, the conference logo and basic instructions
* Tags for labeling blocks
* Scissors / cutting tools located centrally

Additional materials for additional cost:
- Paper tote bags for carrying the materials
- Labels for the tote bags with the conference logo
